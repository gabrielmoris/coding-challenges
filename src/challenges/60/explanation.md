The `wordBreak` function is a JavaScript function that takes two arguments: an object with a string `s` and an object with an array `wordDict`. It is designed to determine whether the input string `s` can be broken into words from the given `wordDict` array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. Initialize the `memo` array:

   - The `memo` array will be used to keep track of the positions in the input string `s` where valid words can be formed.

   ```javascript
   let memo = [];
   ```

2. Iterate through the characters of the input string `s` using a for loop:

   - The loop starts at the beginning of the string and iterates through each character one by one.

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. Initialize the `j` variable to the length of the `memo` array:

   - `j` will be used to traverse the `memo` array backward.

   ```javascript
   let j = memo.length;
   ```

4. While `j` is greater than or equal to 0, enter a while loop:

   - This loop will check if substrings of `s` from `i` back to `memo[j]` form valid words in the `wordDict`.

   ```javascript
   while (j >= 0) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

5. Check if the substring from `memo[j]` to `i` (inclusive) exists in the `wordDict`:

   - It uses the `indexOf` method to check if the substring is present in the `wordDict` array.

   ```javascript
   if (wordDict.indexOf(s.slice(memo[j], i + 1)) >= 0) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

6. If a valid word is found, add the current position `i + 1` to the `memo` array and break out of the loop:

   - This step updates the `memo` array to include the end position of the valid word.

   ```javascript
   memo.push(i + 1);
   break;
   ```

7. If no valid word is found, decrement `j` to check the previous substring in `memo`:

   - This allows the function to backtrack and check if the combination of previous substrings forms valid words.

   ```javascript
   j--;
   ```

8. Continue this process for each character in the input string `s` until the loop is complete.

9. After the loop, check if the last position in the `memo` array matches the length of the input string `s`:

   - If the last position in `memo` is equal to the length of the input string `s`, it means that the entire input string can be broken into words from the `wordDict`.

   ```javascript
   return memo[memo.length - 1] === s.length;
   ```

In summary, the function iterates through the input string and uses a dynamic programming approach to check if the string can be broken into valid words from the `wordDict`. It maintains a `memo` array to keep track of valid positions, and at the end, it checks if the last position in `memo` matches the length of the input string to determine if it's possible to break the string into words.
